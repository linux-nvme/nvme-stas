                            Takes a boolean argument. This option controls how
                            connections with I/O Controllers (IOC) are made.

                            There is no guarantee that there will be a route to
                            reach that IOC. However, we can use the socket
                            option SO_BINDTODEVICE to force the connection to be
                            made on a specific interface instead of letting the
                            routing tables decide where to make the connection.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            This option determines whether <code>stacd</code> will use
                            SO_BINDTODEVICE to force connections on an interface
                            or just rely on the routing tables. The default is
                            to use SO_BINDTODEVICE, in other words, <code>stacd</code> does
                            not ignore the interface.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            BACKGROUND:
                            By default, <code>stacd</code> will connect to IOCs on the same
                            interface that was used to retrieve the discovery
                            log pages. If stafd discovers a DC on an interface
                            using mDNS, and stafd connects to that DC and
                            retrieves the log pages, it is expected that the
                            storage subsystems listed in the log pages are
                            reachable on the same interface where the DC was
                            discovered.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            For example, let's say a DC is discovered on
                            interface ens102. Then all the subsystems listed in
                            the log pages retrieved from that DC must be
                            reachable on interface ens102. If this doesn't work,
                            for example you cannot "ping -I ens102 [storage-ip]",
                            then the most likely explanation is that proxy arp
                            is not enabled on the switch that the host is
                            connected to on interface ens102. Whatever you do,
                            resist the temptation to manually set up the routing
                            tables or to add alternate routes going over a
                            different interface than the one where the DC is
                            located. That simply won't work. Make sure proxy arp
                            is enabled on the switch first.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Setting routes won't work because, by default, <code>stacd</code>
                            uses the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option when it
                            connects to IOCs. This option is used to force a
                            socket connection to be made on a specific interface
                            instead of letting the routing tables decide where
                            to connect the socket. Even if you were to manually
                            configure an alternate route on a different interface,
                            the connections (i.e. host to IOC) will still be
                            made on the interface where the DC was discovered by
                            stafd.
                        </para>

                        <para>

                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>

                <varlistentry>
                    <term><varname>udev-rule=</varname></term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Takes a string argument <parameter>enabled</parameter> or
                            <parameter>disabled</parameter>. This option determines
                            whether <code>nvme-cli</code>'s udev rules for TCP connections
                            will be executed or ignored.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A set of udev rules get installed with <code>nvme-cli</code>
                            that tells the udev daemon (<code>udevd</code>) to look
                            for Asynchronous Event Notifications (AEN) indicating
                            a change of Discovery Log Page Entries (DPLE). These
                            udev rules are typically installed as:
                            <filename>/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-nvmf-autoconnect.rules</filename>
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            When an AEN is detected, <code>udevd</code> instructs
                            <code>systemd</code> to start a service that invokes
                            <code>nvme-cli</code>'s <code>connect-all</code>
                            command. This command retrieves the DLPEs from the
                            Discovery Controller (DC) that sent the AEN and
                            connects to all the I/O Controllers (IOC) listed
                            in the DPLEs.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            In parallel, <code>stafd</code> and <code>stacd</code>
                            react to the AEN in the same way. This results in a
                            race condition between <code>udevd</code> and
                            <code>nvme-stas</code>. <code>nvme-stas</code>
                            is written in Python and runs slower than <code>nvme-cli</code>
                            written in C. In other words, <code>nvme-stas</code>
                            usually loses the race.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            This can be a problem for TCP connections because
                            <code>nvme-cli</code> traditionally doesn't specify
                            the interface (<code>host-iface</code>) when making
                            TCP connections and leaves it to the kernel (and the
                            routing table) to select the best interface.
                            <code>nvme-stas</code>, on the other hand, always
                            tries to make connections on a specific interface
                            (per configuration). Note that a fix was added to
                            <code>nvme-cli</code> so that TCP connections to IOCs
                            will now be made with <code>host-iface</code> specified.
                            That, however, will only be available in post-2.1.2
                            versions of <code>nvme-cli</code>.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            To add insult to injury, when a connection is made
                            without specifying the <code>host-iface</code>, and
                            therefore the kernel decides which interface to use,
                            there is no way to tell from user space (i.e. by
                            <code>nvme-stas</code>) which interface the kernel
                            actually used. A fix was made to the kernel to make
                            TCP connection's interface available to user space
                            applications, but that will only be available in
                            Linux 6.1 (or later).

                        <para>
                            Being able to identify the interface (<code>host-iface</code>)
                            is important to <code>nvme-stas</code>. That's because it
                            uses a Transport Identifier (TID) containing all the
                            parameters (including the <code>host-iface</code>)
                            needed to make connections (see table below).
                            The parameters that compose the TID can be retrieved
                            from the <code>sysfs</code> under <code>/sys/class/nvme/</code>.

                            When <code>nvme-stas</code> makes a connection, it
                            first looks for an existing connection that matches
                            the TID (including a matching <code>host-iface</code>).
                            Since connections made by <code>nvme-cli</code> lack
                            the <code>host-iface</code>, <code>nvme-stas</code>
                            does not find a match. Therefore, <code>nvme-stas</code>
                            will try to make a new connection, which will often
                            be refused by the kernel because a connection already
                            exists.

                            Suffice it to say that issues may arise when both

                            operate in parallel. These issues may vary depending
                            on your version of Linux, <code>nvme-cli</code>,
                            <code>nvme-stas</code>, and/or <code>libnvme</code>.
                            These issues will often result in messages printed
                            by the kernel to the <code>syslog</code>. A typical
                            error message from the kernel may look something like these:

                Connectivity between hosts and subsystems in a fabric is
                controlled by Fabric Zoning. Entities that share a common
                zone (i.e., are zoned together) are allowed to discover each
                other and establish connections between them. Fabric Zoning is
                configured on Discovery Controllers (DC). Users can add/remove
                controllers and/or hosts to/from zones.
            </para>

            <para>
                Hosts have no direct knowledge of the Fabric Zoning configuration
                that is active on a given DC. As a result, if a host is impacted
                by a Fabric Zoning configuration change, it will be notified of
                the connectivity configuration change by the DC via Asynchronous
                Event Notifications (AEN).

            <para>
                DCs notify hosts of connectivity configuration changes by sending
                AENs indicating a "Discovery Log" change. The host uses these AENs as
                a trigger to issue a Get Log Page command. The response to this command
                is used to update the list of DLPEs containing the controllers
                the host is allowed to access.
                Upon reception of the current DLPEs, the host will determine
                whether DLPEs were added and/or removed, which will trigger the
                addition and/or removal of controller connections. This happens in real time
                and may affect active connections to controllers including controllers
                that support I/O operations (IOCs). A host that was previously
                connected to an IOC may suddenly be told that it is no longer
                allowed to connect to that IOC and should disconnect from it.

                The decision by the host to automatically disconnect from an
                IOC following connectivity configuration changes is controlled
                by two parameters: <code>disconnect-scope</code>
                and <code>disconnect-trtypes</code>.

                            In theory, hosts should only connect to IOCs that have
                            been zoned for them. Connections to IOCs that a host
                            is not zoned to have access to should simply not exist.
                            In practice, however, users may not want hosts to
                            disconnect from all IOCs in reaction to connectivity
                            configuration changes (or at least for some of the IOC
                            connections).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Some users may prefer for IOC connections to be "sticky" 
                            and only be removed manually (<code>nvme-cli</code> or 
                            <varname>exclude=</varname>) or removed by a system 
                            reboot. Specifically, they don't want IOC connections 
                            to be removed unexpectedly on DLPE removal. These users 
                            may want to set <varname>disconnect-scope</varname>
                            to <parameter>no-disconnect</parameter>.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            It is important to note that when IOC connections 
                            are removed, ongoing I/O transactions will be 
                            terminated immediately. There is no way to tell what
                            happens to the data being exchanged when such an abrupt
                            termination happens. If a host was in the middle of writing
                            to a storage subsystem, there is a chance that outstanding
                            I/O operations may not successfully complete.

                                            will not be affected, unless they happen to be duplicates
                                            of connections made by <code>stacd</code>. It's simply not
                                            possible for <code>stacd</code> to tell that a connection
                                            was previously made with <code>nvme-cli</code> (or any other external tool).
                                            So, it's good practice to avoid duplicating
                                            configuration between <code>stacd</code> and external tools.

                            The NCC bit (Not Connected to CDC) is a bit returned
                            by the CDC in the EFLAGS field of the DLPE. Only CDCs
                            will set the NCC bit. DDCs will always clear NCC to
                            0. The NCC bit is a way for the CDC to let hosts
                            know that the subsystem is currently not reachable
                            by the CDC. This may indicate that the subsystem is
                            currently down or that there is an outage on the
                            section of the network connecting the CDC to the
                            subsystem.

                            If a host is currently failing to connect to an I/O
                            controller and if the NCC bit associated with that
                            I/O controller is asserted, the host can decide to
                            stop trying to connect to that subsystem until
                            connectivity is restored. This will be indicated by
                            the CDC when it clears the NCC bit.

                            The parameter <varname>connect-attempts-on-ncc=</varname>
                            controls whether <code>stacd</code> will take the
                            NCC bit into account when attempting to connect to
                            an I/O Controller. Setting <varname>connect-attempts-on-ncc=</varname>
                            to 0 means that <code>stacd</code> will ignore
                            the NCC bit and will keep trying to connect. Setting
                            <varname>connect-attempts-on-ncc=</varname> to a
                            non-zero value indicates the number of connection
                            attempts that will be made before <code>stacd</code>
                            gives up trying. Note that this value should be set
                            to a value greater than 1. In fact, when set to 1,
                            <code>stacd</code> will automatically use 2 instead.
                            The reason for this is simple. It is possible that a
                            first connect attempt may fail especially if
                            <code>nvme-cli</code>'s udev rule is enabled (see
                            race condition discussion under the
                            <varname>udev-rule=</varname> parameter above).
