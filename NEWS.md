# STorage Appliance Services (STAS)

## Changes with release 1.1.9

Backporting changes from the main branch:

- Add support for RoCE when handling the TXT field of mDNS messages
- Add `_nvme-disc._udp` to the list of mDNS service types we register for with the Avahi daemon

## Changes with release 1.1.8

- Fix handling of TXT field containing NQN specified with lowercase "nqn" key. TP8009 says that the key for the Discovery Controller's NQN should be specified with the lowercase string "nqn". However, some DC may send an uppercase "NQN". nvme-stas will now support either uppercase "NQN" or lowercase "nqn".

## Changes with release 1.1.7

- Trim white spaces from Discovery Log Pages Entries (DLPE) and Configuration parameters.
  - Parameters such as traddr, trsvcid, etc. may be padded with white spaces. These white spaces need to be trimmed off before sending to the kernel driver.

## Changes with release 1.1.6

- Fix issues with I/O controller connection audits
  - Eliminate pcie devices from list of I/O controller connections to audit
  - Add soaking timer to workaround race condition between kernel and user-space applications on "add" uevents. When the kernel adds a new nvme device (e.g. `/dev/nvme7`) and sends a "add" uevent to notify user-space applications, the attributes associated with that device (e.g. `/sys/class/nvme/nvme7/cntrltype`) may not be fully initialized which can lead `stacd` to dismiss a device that should get audited. 
- Make `sticky-connections=enabled` the default (see `stacd.conf`) 

## Changes with release 1.1.5

- Fix issues introduced in 1.1.3 when enabling Fibre Channel (FC) support. 
  - Eliminate pcie devices from discovery log pages. When enabling FC, pcie was accidentally enabled as well.
  - Fix I/O controller scan and detect algorithm. Again, while adding support for FC, the I/O scan & detect algorithm was modified, but we accidentally made it detect Discovery Controllers as well as I/O controllers.


## ~~Changes with release 1.1.4~~ USE 1.1.5 INSTEAD.

- Fix issues for Fibre Channel (FC) support. 
- Add TESTING.md

## Changes with release 1.1.3

**stacd**: Add I/O controller connection audits. Audits are enabled when the configuration parameter "`sticky-connections`" is disabled.

**stafd**: Preserve and Reload last known configuration on restarts. This is for warm restarts of the `stafd` daemon. This does not apply to system reboots (cold restarts). This is needed to avoid deleting I/O controller (IOC) connections by mistake when restarting `stafd`. It prevents momentarily losing previously acquired Discovery Log Page Entries (DLPE). Since `stacd` relies on acquired DLPEs to determine which connection should be created or deleted, it's important that the list of DLPEs survives a `stafd` restart. Eventually, after `stafd` has restarted and reconnected to all Discovery Controllers (DC), the list will get refreshed and the DLPE cache will get updated. And as the cache gets updated, `stacd` will be able to determine which connections should remain and which one should get deleted.

**`stafd`/`stacd`**: Fixed crash caused by `stafd`/`stacd` calling the wrong callback function during the normal disconnect of a controller. There are two callback functions that can be called after a controller is disconnected, but one of them must only be called on a final disconnect just before the process (`stafd` or `stacd`) exits. The wrong callback was being called on a normal disconnect, which led the process to think it was shutting down.

## ~~Changes with release 1.1.2~~ USE 1.1.3 INSTEAD.

stacd: Bug fix. Check that self._cfg_soak_tmr is not None before dereferencing it.

## Changes with release 1.1.1

Make `sticky-connections=disabled` the default (see `stacd.conf`) 

## Changes with release 1.1

- Add `udev-rule` configuration parameter to `stacd.conf`.
- Add `sticky-connections` configuration parameter to `stacd.conf`.
- Add coverage testing (`make coverage`)
- Add `make uninstall`
- To `README.md`, add mDNS troubleshooting section.

## Changes with release 1.0.1

- Install staslib as pure python package instead of arch-specific.

## Changes with release 1.0

- First public release following TP8009 / TP8010 ratification and publication.

## Changes with release 0.1:

- Initial release
