nvme-stas (3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for libnvme 3.0: nvme-stas 3.0 has been updated to align with the
    libnvme 3.0 release. The libnvme 3.0 update includes significant API changes
    and removes compatibility with prior libnvme versions (≤1.x). As a result,
    nvme-stas 3.0 requires libnvme 3.0 at runtime and is not compatible with
    earlier libnvme releases. Users upgrading to nvme-stas 3.0 must ensure that
    libnvme 3.0 is installed in their environment.
