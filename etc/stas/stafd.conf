# persistent-connections: Whether connections to Discovery Controllers (DC)
#                         are persistent. If stafd is stopped, the connections
#                         will persists. When this is set to false, stafd will
#                         disconnect from all DCs it is connected to when stafd

# ignore-iface: This option controls whether connections with Discovery
#               Controllers (DC) will be forced on a specific interface or

# pleo: Port Local Entries Only. If enabled and supported, when connected to a
#       Direct Discovery Controller (DDC), stafd will ask the DDC to return
#       records for only NVM subsystem ports that are presented through the same
#       NVM subsystem port that received the Get Log Page command. When disabled
#       or not supported by the DDC, the DDC may return NVM subsystems that are
#       not even reachable by the host, including those using a transport
#       different from the transport used for the Get Log Page command (e.g. Get
#       Log Page using TCP and receiving FC subsystems). This configuration
#       parameter has no effect if the DDC does not support PLEO (see PLEOS).

[Service Discovery]
# zeroconf: Control whether DNS-SD/mDNS automatic discovery is enabled. This is

[Controllers]
# controller: Discovery Controllers (DC) are specified with this keyword.
#
#             Syntax:
#               controller = transport=[trtype];traddr=[traddr];trsvcid=[trsvcid];host-traddr=[traddr];host-iface=[iface];nqn=<dcnqn>
#
#             transport=<trtype>   [MANDATORY]
#               This field specifies the network fabric being used for a NVMe-over-
#               Fabrics network. Current string values include:
#
#               Value   Definition
#               ------- -----------------------------------------------------------
#               rdma    The network fabric is an rdma network (RoCE, iWARP,
#                       Infiniband, basic rdma, etc)
#               fc      The network fabric is a Fibre Channel network.
#               tcp     The network fabric is a TCP/IP network.
#               loop    Connect to a NVMe over Fabrics target on the local host
#
#             traddr=<traddr>      [MANDATORY]
#               This field specifies the network address of the Controller. For
#               transports using IP addressing (e.g. rdma) this should be an IP-
#               based address (ex. IPv4, IPv6). It could also be a resolvable host
#               name (e.g. localhost).
#
#             nqn=<dcnqn>          [OPTIONAL]
#               This field specifies the Discovery Controller's NVMe Qualified
#               Name. If not specified, this will default to the well-known DC
#               NQN: "nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress.discovery".
#
#             trsvcid=<trsvcid>    [OPTIONAL]
#               This field specifies the transport service id. For transports using
#               IP addressing (e.g. rdma) this field is the port number.
#
#               Depending on the transport type, this field will default to either
#               8009 or 4420 as follows.
#
#               UDP port 4420 and TCP port 4420 have been assigned by IANA
#               for use by NVMe over Fabrics. NVMe/RoCEv2 controllers use UDP port
#               4420 by default. NVMe/iWARP controllers use TCP port 4420 by
#               default.
#
#               TCP port 4420 has been assigned for use by NVMe over Fabrics and TCP
#               port 8009 has been assigned by IANA for use by NVMe over Fabrics
#               discovery. TCP port 8009 is the default TCP port for NVMe/TCP
#               discovery controllers. There is no default TCP port for NVMe/TCP I/O
#               controllers, the Transport Service Identifier (TRSVCID) field in the
#               Discovery Log Entry indicates the TCP port to use.
#
#               The TCP ports that may be used for NVMe/TCP I/O controllers include
#               TCP port 4420, and the Dynamic and/or Private TCP ports (i.e., ports
#               in the TCP port number range from 49152 to 65535). NVMe/TCP I/O
#               controllers should not use TCP port 8009. TCP port 4420 shall not be
#               used for both NVMe/iWARP and NVMe/TCP at the same IP address on the
#               same network.

#
#             host-traddr=<traddr> [OPTIONAL]
#               This field specifies the network address used on the host to connect
#               to the Controller. For TCP, this sets the source address on the
#               socket.
#
#             host-iface=<iface>   [OPTIONAL]
#               This field specifies the network interface used on the host to
#               connect to the Controller (e.g. IP eth1, enp2s0, enx78e7d1ea46da).
#               This forces the connection to be made on a specific interface
#               instead of letting the system decide.
#
#             Multiple DCs may be specified on separate lines like this (this is
#             just an example and does not represent default values):
#
#             controller = transport=tcp;traddr=localhost;trsvcid=8009
#             controller = transport=tcp;traddr=2001:db8::370:7334;host-iface=enp0s8
#             controller = transport=fc;traddr=nn-0x204600a098cbcac6:pn-0x204700a098cbcac6
#                 ...
#
#             Type: String
#
#             Default: There is no default controller. STAF will not try to
#                      connect to a default Discovery Controller.
#controller=


# exclude: Excluded controllers. Using mDNS to automatically detect
#          and connect controllers, can result in unintentional connections
#          being made. This keyword allows configuring the controllers that
#          should not be connected to (whatever the reason may be).
#
#          The syntax is the same as for "controller=", except that the key
#          host-traddr does not apply. Multiple "exclude=" keywords may
#          appear in the config file to define the exclusion list.
#
#          Note 1: A minimal match approach is used to eliminate unwanted
#          controllers. That is, you do not need to specify all the
#          parameters to identify a controller. Just specifying the
#          host-iface, for example, can be used to exclude all controllers
#          on an interface.
#
#          Note 2: "exclude=" takes precedence over "controller=". A
#          controller specified by the "controller=" keyword, can be
#          eliminated by the "exclude=" keyword.
#
#          Syntax: Same as "controller=" above.
#          Type:   String
#
#          Example:
#           exclude = transport=tcp;traddr=fe80::2c6e:dee7:857:26bb # Eliminate a specific address
#           exclude = host-iface=enp0s8                             # Eliminate everything on this interface
#exclude=
